2024-03-25 - found code for intersecting PREC and HUI
I do not think this code is anywhere else in pynocda

Code was in the folder:
G:\Shared drives\HRRC_IN-CORE\Tasks\M5.2-01 Pop inventory\github_com\npr99\Population_Inventory\pyincore_data_addons\SourceData\api_census_gov

And also on GitHub private repo
